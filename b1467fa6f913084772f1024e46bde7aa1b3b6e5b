      "message": "This winds up always capturing the bottom-most portion of the stack (highest addresses), but that’s not the most useful portion of the stack. The top-most portion (lowest addresses) are much more valuable, because that’s got all of the valuable information about what was going on when the crash occurred, and in fact has all of the return addresses and saved frame pointers necessary to even walk the stack at all given a crash context.",
