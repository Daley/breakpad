(Maybe it understands `-std\u003dc++1z`?) That would be pre-GCC 5, I think, which is quite old at this point (from 2015). What version is it?\n\nIn any event, if you leave out `ext` and `noext` entirely, autoconf is supposed to figure out which works, and I think use `noext` if possible and `ext` if it has to. That’s probably the one we want.",

At `-std\u003dc++17`, `__STRICT_ANSI__` is a compiler pre-defined macro, but it’s not at `-std\u003dgnu++17`. `__STRICT_ANSI__` operates in Cygwin’s `\u003csys/features.h\u003e` to not set `_DEFAULT_SOURCE`, which results in `_POSIX_C_SOURCE` also not being set (unless you’ve done something special from the outside, like defining `_GNU_SOURCE` or any of these other macros). There’s a straightforward chain from there to `__POSIX_VISIBLE`, as well as a direct link between `_DEFAULT_SOURCE` and `__MISC_VISIBLE`. Similar for `__XSI_VISIBLE` as well.\n\nOther systems don’t seem to take such a heavy-handed approach with `__STRICT_ANSI__`, but I can’t really argue that Cygwin’s wrong, either.\n\n`\u003csys/cdefs.h\u003e`-type headers like this are typically really thorny so I understand if you just want to back away and either:\n - leave out `ext` and `noext`, or\n - stick with `17, noext` but also introduce `AC_USE_SYSTEM_EXTENSIONS` which should turn back on most or all of the stuff that Cygwin’s disabling when it notices `__STRICT_ANSI__`.",
