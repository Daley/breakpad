      "message": "It\u0027s a good question, and a bit subtle. Before this change, the handler kept track of the base address and did this addition itself, which made some sense because every call to AddRange needed the base_address added. But with dwarf5, some do, but many do not. So I moved the base_address handling into the reader. See the change to dwarf_range_list_handler.cc.\n\nI debated what to do here, but adding another switch on all the different forms in AddRange seemed unnecessary, when we could do the math before the call.",
