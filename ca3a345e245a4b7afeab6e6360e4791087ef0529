I\u0027d expect DWARFv5 sec_offset rnglist should be read directly from the \u0027data\u0027 value, same as v4.\n\n(is this case tested? Oh, I see the test case was changed to subtract 12 from the offset - I think that change is incorrect)\n\nMight be worth testing all this, at least manually with some real DWARF from Clang?",
