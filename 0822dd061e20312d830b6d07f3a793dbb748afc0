      "message": "Hmm I have to admit I have never been a huge user of autotools, maybe Mike is a better candidate for this one. sry for bouncing this Mike, I am not too familiar with what are the best patterns to follow for autotools.\n\n\nThe only thing that makes me a bit skeptical here is the fact that when looking at https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/manual/autoconf-2.67/html_node/Preset-Output-Variables.html I see:\n```\nFor example, it is permissible to reference ‘$srcdir’ when constructing a list of directories to pass via option -I during a compiler feature check. When used in this manner, coupled with the fact that configure is always run from the top build directory, it is sufficient to use just ‘$srcdir’ instead of ‘$top_srcdir’.\n```\n\nSo if configure always runs from the root, why top_srcdir is not enough here?",
