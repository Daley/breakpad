The files in this directory were taken directly from Android NDK r12 with minor
changes. The changes are:
  1. Surrounding the contents with #ifdef __mips__ since these are MIPS-specific
     headers in a common location.
  2. Adding #if __has_include_next and #include_next to try to use the NDK's
     versions if they're available.
These files intentionally removed from the NDK during the move to unified
headers, which causes Breakpad compilation issues on newer NDK versions.
