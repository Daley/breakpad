These headers were copied from the macOS 10.7 SDK (and updated in 2023 to 13.3) 
to enable building the Mac dump_syms code that processes Mach-O files on Linux.
NB: if updating these, please ensure to replace
```
defined (__arm__) || defined(__arm64__)
```
to
```
defined (__aarch64__)
```
to ensure Linux compatibility.
