These headers were copied from the macOS 10.7 SDK (and updated in 2023 to 13.3) 
to enable building the Mac dump_syms code that processes Mach-O files on Linux.
NB: if updating these, make sure to replace
```
defined(__arm64__)
with
```
defined(__arm64__) || defined (__aarch64__)
```
to ensure Linux compatibility.
