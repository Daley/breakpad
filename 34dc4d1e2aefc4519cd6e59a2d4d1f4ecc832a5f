      "message": "this doesn\u0027t look correct to me.  the \"page size\" is defined by psABI specs and is not the same everywhere ... it\u0027s not even guaranteed to be the same across different operating systems for the same architecture.\n\noff the top of my head, i\u0027m not aware of anyone using page size smaller than 4k, but i also wouldn\u0027t be surprised if someone showed up.\n\nnormally the linking process that creates the ELF is responsible for applying appropriate page rounding.  so this CL seems to be trying to correct for broken tools or something ?  really needs more detail in the commit message as to what the problem is that this is trying to resolve.\n\nalso the code itself needs comments as to why 4 KiB was picked, and why it\u0027s ignoring data from the ELF.",
