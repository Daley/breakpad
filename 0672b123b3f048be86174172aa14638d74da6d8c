The uploaded symbol file was always overwriting the existing one.\n\nCan you please clarify in a comment what exactly happens when the file already exists? Is it overwritten? If not, then how do you overwrite a previously uploaded bad symbol file with a good one?",

While that does require changes to maintain backward compatibility, there are already more substantial changes required when switching to v2 (e.g. adding the API key), so I don\u0027t think that\u0027s really a problem. However, the significance of the different return codes should probably be mentioned in the Usage().",
