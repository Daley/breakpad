      "message": "There could be a potential issue here. The behavior is different when using the V1 interface. Using the V1 endpoint, uploading the same symbol file was always succeeding. The uploaded symbol file was always overwriting the existing one.\n\nCan you please clarify in a comment what exactly happens when the file already exists? Is it overwritten? If not, then how do you overwrite a previously uploaded bad symbol file with a good one?",

      "message": "IIUC, the previous behavior would be the same as running v2 with the \"-f\" (force) option, which is mentioned in the error logging. While that does require changes to maintain backward compatibility, there are already more substantial changes required when switching to v2 (e.g. adding the API key), so I don\u0027t think that\u0027s really a problem. However, the significance of the different return codes should probably be mentioned in the Usage().",
