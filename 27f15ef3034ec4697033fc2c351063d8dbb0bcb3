      "message": "Hi Mike,\n\nI recently tried to build Breakpad from source on an older Linux machine, and core_handler specifically fails to build due to the lack of memfd_create in \u003csys/mman.h\u003e until glibc \u003e\u003d 2.27. I think we\u0027d be better off if we maintain support for building on machines with glibc \u003c 2.27, unless we can confirm that Breakpad doesn\u0027t intend to support this?\n\nThanks!\n- Eric",
