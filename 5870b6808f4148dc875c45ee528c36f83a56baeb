      "message": "Thanks for taking a look. Few questions:\n- What would be the supported libcurl versions to be used by breakpad? (for CrOS right now we use 7.84 and uprev-ing to 7.87)\n- Would it be possible for multiple crash dumps to be uploaded at the same time in a single program (i.e. 2 or more curl calls at the same time)? If so, then we might also want to call `curl_global_init`.\n\nAs to resolve the curl uprev, I\u0027m seeing that we can:\na) Gate the `curl_global_init` and `curl_global_cleanup` by curl version i.e. querying `curl_version_info`.\nb) Using the already available curl mock for breakpad units to avoid the leak in the units.\n\nI\u0027m assuming that (a) is preferred here. Would it be a good approach or do you have any recommendation? Thank you.",
