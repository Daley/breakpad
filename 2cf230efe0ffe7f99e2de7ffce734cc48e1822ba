I only tested this on CrOS, and can\u0027t touch labels on this Gerrit, so I\u0027m unsure what sort of presubmit testing should be performed here.\n\nI considered \u0027asking for forgiveness\u0027 here, too: since we `setrlimit` in a forked child, that required weaving very specific exit codes through \u0026\u0026 refactoring `CreateChildCrash` to return one of 3 values. If that\u0027s what folks would prefer, I\u0027m happy to do it, but I think we can get the same answer in a more direct way by asking for `getrlimit` ahead of time?",
