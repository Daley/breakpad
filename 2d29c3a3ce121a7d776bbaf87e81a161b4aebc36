      "message": "Oh, I missed that CL. Yup, that addresses the same issue!\n\nChecking the \".note.gnu.build-id\" section first covers the Android case, and likely is sufficient in general.\n\nThe bug in `ElfClassBuildIDNoteIdentifier` (not checking the note namespace, just the type) remains, but if toolchains consistently name the section that the note of type NT_GNU_BUILD_ID is added to \".note.gnu.build-id\", then it\u0027s inconsequential. \n\nConsidering [this commit](https://chromium.googlesource.com/breakpad/breakpad/+/b6e66b294fe5d851ffbb57c1527acccf2f53a4b5) which added support for reading the note from `PT_NOTE` segments (as opposed to just the \".note.gnu.build-id\"), are there cases where just checking the section isn\u0027t enough?",
